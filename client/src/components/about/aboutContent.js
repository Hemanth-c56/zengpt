        title: "Zens Creation",
        description : "ZenGPT was developed through a two-step process: pre-training and fine-tuning. In the pre-training phase, the model was exposed to a diverse dataset containing internet text, learning to predict the next word in a sentence based on context. This phase enabled the model to grasp grammar, facts, reasoning, and some world knowledge. Subsequently, the model underwent fine-tuning on a specific dataset with human reviewers following Gemini's guidelines. These guidelines aimed to refine the model's behavior, ensuring it produces safe and appropriate responses.",
